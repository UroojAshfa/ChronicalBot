üìú ChronicleBot: A Conversational AI for Historical Exploration
ChronicleBot is an interactive chatbot designed to engage users in historical exploration, enabling them to ask questions about significant events, influential figures, and time periods. Built on top of Wikipedia and other knowledge sources, ChronicleBot provides insightful answers, follow-up suggestions, and even visualizes events on a historical timeline. This project leverages advanced NLP techniques, APIs, and interactive visualizations to create an intuitive and enriching experience for history enthusiasts and researchers alike.



üöÄ Features
1. Conversational Historical Queries
Ask Anything About History: Users can ask questions about historical events, figures, and periods, and ChronicleBot returns contextually relevant responses sourced directly from Wikipedia.
Follow-Up Suggestions: ChronicleBot generates follow-up questions to guide users deeper into the historical context or suggest related topics of interest, creating a conversation-like flow that enhances the exploration of historical topics.
2. Enriched Data Retrieval from Wikipedia
Knowledge Base from Wikipedia: By utilizing Wikipedia's extensive information repository, ChronicleBot ensures that users get access to a broad range of historical knowledge with every query.
Semantic Search: The bot uses semantic search capabilities to match user questions with relevant information in Wikipedia, ensuring contextually accurate responses that go beyond simple keyword matching.
3. User-Friendly Streamlit Interface
Intuitive Chat UI: ChronicleBot's interface, built on Streamlit, allows for a seamless and user-friendly chat experience, designed for ease of access and smooth interactions.
Clear and Organized Responses: Responses are structured to make the information easy to read and understand, with conversational continuity between user queries and the bot‚Äôs follow-up questions.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Streamlit: Powers the front-end interface, providing an interactive and responsive chat experience within a simple and user-friendly design.

Transformers (Hugging Face): Utilizes Transformer models for semantic search and classification to enhance the relevance of responses, making the bot‚Äôs answers more contextually accurate.

Sentence Transformers: Employed for creating vector embeddings and performing similarity matching between user queries and Wikipedia content, ensuring robust, semantically-driven answers.

Wikipedia API: Serves as the primary knowledge source, enabling the bot to fetch and display summarized, well-sourced historical information.

PyTorch: Provides the backend framework for running machine learning and NLP models, facilitating classification and search tasks.
